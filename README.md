# HSW-garbo — Liminal Payroll and Analytics Manager

A hackathon project built on the **Liminal / Nim Go SDK hackathon starter**.  
This app helps companies manage an employee directory and run payroll using Liminal’s wallet, savings, and payroll tools (with **confirmation required** for any money movement).

## Project structure

  frontend/                # Vite + React + TS UI
  internal/
    api/                   # HTTP handlers (REST)
    storage/               # DB + employee storage layer
  main.go                  # server entrypoint
```

---

## Common troubleshooting

### `/api/*` returns the frontend page instead of JSON
This usually means the frontend is not reaching the Go server.

Check:
- the backend is running (e.g. on `:8080`)
- the frontend is calling the correct base URL or using a dev proxy
- try opening backend directly: `http://localhost:8080/api/employees`
